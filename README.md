# Deep_learning_project1
Detect Dog's facial emotions using Deep Learning
# Project Overview

In this project, we'll figure out what emotion a dog is feeling based on a picture.  We'll use deep learning to analyze the image and predict the emotion. Then we'll then train a neural network to make predictions about what emotion a dog is feeling.  We'll end by evaluating how to improve the model.

We'll use Pytorch and torchvision to train the model.

At the end, you'll have a trained deep learning model that can predict dog emotions.

**Project Steps**

* Download the images for dataset to train further.
* Train a deep learning model to predict dog emotions.
* Evaluate the model.

## Code

You can find the code for this project [here](https://github.com/sahit1011/Deep_learning_project1)

File overview:

* `prediction.ipynb` - train a neural network to predict if a dog is in an image.
* `settings.py` - has constants that are needed in other files.

# Prerequisites

To complete this project, you'll need to have a good understanding of:

* Python syntax, including functions, if statements, and data structures
* Pandas syntax
* Using Jupyter notebook

You'll also need to know the basics of the command line and machine learning.
